The algorithm can be broken down into three components, the dungeon, the room, and each opening within a room.  Each component will follow a simple set of steps until the dungeon is finished being generated.

Dungeon’s Perspective
Step 1: Spawn a room
Step 2: Get the first available room that has unconnected openings
Step 3: Tell the room to spawn its’ adjacent chambers
Step 4: Wait until the room’s openings have spawned
Step 5: Add Created Rooms to the dungeon
Step 6: Repeat 2 – 6 until there are no more unconnected openings

Room’s Perspective
Step 1: Get all the room openings
Step 2: Iterate over each opening and spawn adjacent chamber
Step 3: Wait until all adjacent chambers are spawned and are in a valid state
Step 4: Notify dungeon new rooms are ready

Room Opening Level
Step 1: Get available pieces from the dungeon to spawn
Step 2: Spawn a connected piece
Step 3: Wait for the validation period to complete
Step 4: Mark the opening as connected and notify the 
              room that a connected chamber is ready

New Room Validation
- A room becomes invalid if it intersects another room
- If it becomes invalid then the room will destroy itself and notify the connection point to try a different piece.
- If all the pieces are attempted and nothing will fit, then the connection point will close off the room with a wall instead.
